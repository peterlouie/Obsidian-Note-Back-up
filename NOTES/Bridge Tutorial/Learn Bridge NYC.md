# The Basic

What is a trick?
	A trick starts with one player putting a card face up on the table. This is called
	leading a card. After the Lead there are some things we need to know….

RULES:
	• Play always proceeds clockwise around the table until each player has
		played a card to the trick.
	• All players must Follow Suit at all times.
	• So, when West leads the 2 of Hearts every player must play a Heart to
		this trick if they have one.
	• When you have no cards left in the suit led, you can play any card from your
		hand to the trick.

Some Terms to know:
	Lead – to play the first card to a trick
	Follow – to play a card from the same suit led (we must do this at all times, if
		we have a card in the suit led)
	Discard – to play a card different from the suit led to a trick.
		(East is “Discarding” the 10 of Clubs on this hand)

HIGHEST CARD IN SUIT LED WINS THE TRICK

**Auction** - This is where each pair has the opportunity to describe their hands and decide on
		the final contract. (See “Basic Bidding in Bridge” to learn about The Auction)

**Declarer** -  is the person that will control both the dummy and their own hand during the play portion.
		- The player that introduced the suit of the final contract will be what is called “The Declarer”

**Opening Lead** - The player to the Declarer’s immediate left will choose any card they want from 
			their  hand and place it face up on the table. this lead starts the 1st of the 13 tricks 
			on every single bridge hand

**Dummy** - 13 card hand face up on the table

**Trump Rule** - With a trump suit, the highest trump card played to the trick will win it. 
			If no trump are played during a trick, then the no – trump rule applies.

**Trumping** – to play a trump card after a player has led a different suit. (this will win the trick, unless 
		another player plays a higher trump card to the same trick)

Finesse - is the most important card play technique necessary to improve your declarer play

-  Finessing in it’s purest form is literally NO RISK

Double Finesse - When we are missing two honors we can gain tricks in certain positions 
			by taking two finesses

There are Two Segments to every Bridge Hand.

**Auction** - During the Auction, each player will make bids to describe what cards they 
		hold in their hand. This is an effort to determine how many tricks each 
		side can take.
		- is the segment of the bridge hand that allows the players to communicate 
		key features of their hands to the table and most importantly to their partners. 

**Play** - During the Play, the side that won the Auction will try to take the number of tricks
		necessary to achieve their contract.

**Contract** - The last bid of the auction will be “The Contract”
### What's a Bid?

When it is a player’s turn in the auction they
can choose whether to Pass or to make a Bid.

Every potential bid that can be made during
the Auction portion of the bridge hand is to
the right.

As you can see there are a lot of choices in
this bidding box. Ranging from the lowest
ranking bid of 1 Club to the highest ranking
bid of 7 No – Trump.

The auction will go in order of the bid
rankings you see to your right.

So if one player bids 1 Heart, the players
after him can not bid 1 Club or 1 Diamond. If
they want to bid Clubs they would have to
proceed to the 2 Level by bidding 2 Clubs.

STAYMAN - is one of the most useful and, as a result, most famous Bridge Conventions of all time.
		- is only used after our side has opened or overcalled No-Trump
		- we will always have at least one major of exactly 4 cards
		- The only responses to stayman are:
			- 2 D: No 4 card or longer major
			- 2 H: 4 card heart suit
			- 2 S: 4 card space suit
