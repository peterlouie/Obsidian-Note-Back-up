		-You should actively seek honest feedback from those you respect. But if someone just has a history of being a naysayer, ignore them

9. **Find wise people to emulate**
		-It will even do socialize with men of good character, in order to model your life on theirs, whether you choose someone living or someone from the past
		-Identify role models
			Who is doing this right now?
			Who has successfully achieved this goal?

			Who has made this change?
			What can I learn?

10. **Honestly Review your day**
		-Characteristics of the rational soul
			Self-awareness
			Self-examination
			Self-determination
		-One of the best ways to become more disciplined is to scrutinize yourself, and find your weak spots
			What did I do well?
			Where was my discipline tested?
			How can I improve?
			What did I do bad?
		-Forgiving yourself prevents you from continuing to put things off
		-Think about what you did well so you can repeat it tomorrow. Be grateful for the good that happened today

The moment you wake up, remember that the new day is a new life and move forward by opening your eyes and focusing on what's in front of you, which is life it self
